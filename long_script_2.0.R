##### Explaining the data sets

##### First data set: all Harvard University employee contributions, 2001-2014
head(contribs) # As you can see, this data set has individual entries for each transaction

# Let's look at the kind of data columns we have here:
names(contribs)
# X is a remnant of the row number from the original spreadsheet
# NAME, ZIP_CODE, EMPLOYER, OCCUPATION, TRANSACTION_DT (date), 
# TRANSACTION_AMT (amount), PARTY are all fairly self-explanatory

# TRANSACTION_PGI indicates which election the donation was made for:
contribs$TRANSACTION_PGI[1:40] # We will mainly be concerned with the Presidential (P),
# Gubernatorial (G), and Congressional (C)

# CMTE_NM, CMTE_DSGN, CMTE_TP = Committee Name, Designation, and Type

levels(contribs$PARTY)
# DEM = Democratic, REP = Republican, DFL = Democratic-Farmer-Labor, GRE = Green
# IND = Independent, NNE = None, UNK = Unknown
# UNK contributions are to Women's Campaign Party = non-partisan


##### Second data set: the unique Harvard Univeristy employee contributors,
# with additional employment information for 2011-2014 donations
head(people)


##### Third data set: the union of the first two data sets, for years 2011-2014
head(contribs.tagged)
#################################################


#################################################
##### Checking off required elements: the dataset

# 1.  A dataframe
class(people); class(contribs); class(contribs.tagged) 
# We have three! 

# 2.  At least two categorical or logical columns
head(contribs.tagged) 
# Look at all those categorical columns!  TITLE, SCHOOL, etc 

# 3.  At least two numeric columns
head(contribs.tagged) 
# We have transaction date and transaction amounts for numerical columns

# 4.  At least 20 rows, preferably more, but real-world data may be limited
nrow(people); nrow(contribs); nrow(contribs.tagged)

##### Modifications of the data sets for easier analysis

# Let's start by modifying the 2001-2014 contribution data, 'contribs' 
# to better suit our analysis

# Read TRANSACTION_DT as Date objects
contribs$TRANSACTION_DT <- as.Date(contribs$TRANSACTION_DT); head(contribs$TRANSACTION_DT)
# Add a column for month-year of transaction as well

# Create a column where we lump some of the party affiliations together
contribs$PARTY2<-contribs$PARTY
levels(contribs$PARTY2)
levels(contribs$PARTY2) <- c("DEM", "DEM", "GRE", "IND", "NA", "REP", "NA", "NA")
levels(contribs$PARTY2)


# Now modify the second data set, 'people'
# Merge schools with less than 10 contributors into OTHER (except HMC)
levels(people$SCHOOL) <- c("CADM","FAS","OTHER","GSE","OTHER","HBS","HKS","HLS","HMC","HMS","OTHER","OTHER","OTHER","SEAS","SPH","OTHER")


# Now modify the third data set, 'contribs.tagged'
# Add level merges for SCHOOL from people data frame
levels(contribs.tagged$SCHOOL) <- c("CADM","FAS","OTHER","GSE","OTHER","HBS","HKS","HLS","HMC","HMS","OTHER","OTHER","OTHER","SEAS","SPH","OTHER")
# Add a column with formatted transaction date
contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT <- as.character(contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT); class(contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT)

# Had to add a 0 to the from of some of the dates
for (i in 1:length(contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT)){
  contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT[i]<-ifelse(nchar(contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT[i])!=8, paste0("0",contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT[i]),contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT[i])
}

contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT <- as.Date(contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT,format="%m%d%Y"); head(contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT)
# Add a column for month-year just like in the 2001-2014 data
contribs.tagged$YEARMON <- as.yearmon(contribs.tagged$TRANSACTION_DT); head(contribs.tagged$YEARMON)

#### Linear regression 

# Let's take a look and see if we can fit a linear regression model to

# For instance, and for a sanity check really, let's take the example of
# our most recent presidential elections: 
# President Barack Obama was elected for a first term in November, 2008
# Let's look at the donations leading up to and after his election

# Do this first for the sum and median and count of all donations / month

#### Appropriate (ab)use of correlation

# Let's ask the question: are the sum or mean donations

gender.sum <- as.data.frame(as.list(aggregate(TRANSACTION_AMT ~ GENDER + YEARMON, data = contribs.tagged, sum)));

# Split by gender into two subsets
fem.sum<-data.frame(subset(gender.sum,subset = gender.sum$GENDER == "F")); head(fem.sum) # Female donations
male.sum<-data.frame(subset(gender.sum,subset = gender.sum$GENDER == "M")); head(male.sum) # Male donations

# Is there a correlation? Or do men and women donate differently over the course of the year?
cor(fem.sum$DONATION,male.sum$DONATION)
# Moderately positively correlated! It would seem that we have some evidence that men and women
# increase or decrease similarly in sum donation over the course of the year 


# Let's try the same analysis on the mean donation for both sexes! 
gender.mean <- as.data.frame(as.list(aggregate(TRANSACTION_AMT ~ GENDER + YEARMON, data = contribs.tagged, mean)));

male.mean<-data.frame(subset(gender.mean,subset = gender.mean$GENDER == "M")); head(male.mean) # Male donations

cor(fem.mean$DONATION,male.mean$DONATION)
# Interesting! We can see that mean donation between the sexes is ever so slightly 
# negatively correlated! Mostly non-correlated! 

# Could this be because the standard deviation of donations? 
gender.sd <- as.data.frame(as.list(aggregate(TRANSACTION_AMT ~ GENDER + YEARMON, data = contribs.tagged, sd)));

mean(na.omit(fem.max$DONATION))

# It would appear that the men have a larger average standard deviation
# and a larger average max donation per month... This could explain why the
# correlation between the sum donations was positive, but the mean was uncorrelated,
# but we can't really reach any conclusions without looking at the individual data points!

plot(fem.mean$DONATION, male.mean$DONATION); abline(lm(male.mean$DONATION~fem.mean$DONATION)) # Regression line does not fit wel

# We can see from the plots that the reason the mean values are not correlated is because they are held
# at roughly the same level across most of the time points. There are no up or down trends in either, from which
# we could (mathematically) deduce correlation
